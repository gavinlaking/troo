Troo: CLI interface for Trello.

You will need user authentication tokens to access your Trello
account.

- Sign in to Trello, and then create your developer key by visiting:
  https://trello.com/1/appKey/generate

- Go to:
  https://trello.com/1/connect?key=your_key_here&name=troo&response_type=token&scope=read,write

- Add your authentication tokens to the configuration file `.trooconf`
  in your home directory. (This file has just been created for you.)

- Have fun!
