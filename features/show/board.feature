Feature: Showing a board

  @show
  Scenario: Showing a board with ID
    Given a board exists
    When I run `troo show board 200`
    Then the output should contain:
      """
      (1) My Test Board

      No lists were found.
      """

  @show
  Scenario: Cannot show board; not found
    Given the Trello API is stubbed with "400_board_by_id"
    When I run `troo show board 400`
    Then the output should contain "Board cannot be found."

  @show
  Scenario: Showing the default board
    Given a default board exists
    When I run `troo show board`
    Then the output should contain:
      """
      * (1) My Default Board

      No lists were found.
      """

  @show
  Scenario: Cannot show; no default board
    When I run `troo show board`
    Then the output should contain "set a default board first"
