Feature: Showing comments

  @show
  Scenario: Showing comments for a card with ID
    Given a comment exists
    When I run `troo show comments 200`
    Then the output should contain:
      """
      My Test Comment
      """

  @show
  Scenario: Showing comments for a card with ID; no comments
    Given a card exists
    When I run `troo show comments 200`
    Then the output should contain "No comments"

  @show
  Scenario: Cannot show comments; card not found
    Given the Trello API is stubbed with "400_card_by_id"
    When I run `troo show comments 400`
    Then the output should contain "Card cannot be found."

  @show
  Scenario: Showing the comments for the default card
    Given a default card exists
    And a comment exists
    When I run `troo show comments`
    Then the output should contain:
      """
      * (1) My Default Card

      @gavinlaking1:
        My Test Comment
          (Tue, Dec 17 at 22:01)
      """

  @show
  Scenario: Cannot show comments; no default card
    When I run `troo show comments`
    Then the output should contain "set a default card first"
