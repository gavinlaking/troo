Feature: Showing a list

  @show
  Scenario: Showing a list with ID
    Given a list exists
    When I run `troo show list 200`
    Then the output should contain:
      """
       (1) My Test Board
           (1) My Test List
             No cards were found.
      """

  @show
  Scenario: Cannot show list; not found
    Given the Trello API is stubbed with "400_list_by_id"
    When I run `troo show list 400`
    Then the output should contain "List cannot be found."

  @show
  Scenario: Showing the default list
    Given a default list exists
    When I run `troo show list`
    Then the output should contain:
      """
       (1) My Test Board
          * (1) My Default List
             No cards were found.
      """

  @show
  Scenario: Cannot show; no default list
    When I run `troo show list`
    Then the output should contain "set a default list first"
